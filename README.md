Published documents made available to users who, in turn, use search engines to find them. To deliver the closest searched documents, these documents must be previously indexed and classified. With the huge volume of documents published every day, many researches have been carried out in order to find a way of dealing with the automatic document classification. 

The goal of this article is to discuss an automatic classification experience of some journalistic documents published on the Internet. The experiment uses the Vector Model representation. In doing so, we used a real journalistic database, some algorithms widely used in the literature to test the model we discussed here. The article also describes the performance evaluation metrics of these algorithms and the settings required for the reproduction of the same. The results show the method's efficiency and justifies the researches which aim at facilitating and improving the automatic document classification techniques.
